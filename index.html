    <h1>FIFA World Cup 2014 News</h1>
    <p>The biggeest score in the history of the <b> FIFA World Cup </b> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31 -0.</p>
    <p>This legendary match also brought global renown for Archie Thompson, whose 13 -goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.</p>
    <p>And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, <i> 'Next Goal Wins' </i>, showing across the world.</P>
